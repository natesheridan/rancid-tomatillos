Rancid Tomatillos is a web application that utilizes the 'create-react-app' package. Using this package created our first react app - Rancid Tomatillos. Rancid Tomatillos - not to be confused with Rotten Tomotoes - focuses on being able to show the user a database of movies in a persentable way and allow interaction such as saving, reviewing, and watching trailers of said movies. Although not all features are implemented just yet - our app still provides a great way to parse through a database of movies and view information about the movies.

## Challenges

Dumbing down our vanilla JS minds to work better with react. 


## Wins
A great first look at react and how powerful it is as a framework. Things that would have taken us hours to code in react takes 10 minutes. As mentioned above - React takes a lot of the guess work out of coding, and we were not used to that. After having gone through this project, we can step away from it with a new understanding of "reusable code"

## Future Features

Ratings System ‚≠êÔ∏è
Deploy our own ExpressJS API backend - for use with external data to algorithmically map our movie list. (Coolest car scenes, best car appearances in movies, etc.)
